 The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest possible tour that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city. 
 In this example, we'll use a simple representation of solutions as permutations of cities.

In this example, the TSP is represented as a permutation of cities. 
The hyper-heuristic applies high-level heuristics that, in turn, apply low-level heuristics such as swapping two cities or reversing a segment of the tour. 
The objective function calculates the total Euclidean distance of the tour, and the algorithm aims to maximize this distance (negative sign).
